// I've provided you with an array of strings called people.
// Loop over the people array with a for loop, printing out each name in uppercase letters.
// Your result should look something like:

const people = ["Scooby", "Velma", "Daphne", "Shaggy", "Fred"]; //DONT TOUCH THIS LINE!

// WRITE YOUR LOOP BELOW THIS LINE:
for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
    console.log(people[i].toUpperCase());
}
